    <p>Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action role-playing game developed and published 
        by miHoYo Co., Ltd. Outside of China, the publisher is miHoYo's subsidiary Cognosphere Pte., Ltd. d/b/a HoYoverse.</p>
    <p>The game features a fantasy open-world environment and action based combat system using elemental magic, character

         The game can only be played with an internet connection and features a limited multiplayer mode allowing up to four players in a world.</p>
    <p>Genshin Impact takes place in the fantasy world of Teyvat, which is home to seven nations, each of which is tied to a different element and ruled by a different god. The story follows the Traveler, who has traveled across countless worlds with their twin sibling before becoming separated in Teyvat. The Traveler travels in search of the lost sibling with their companion Paimon and becomes involved in the affairs of Teyvat's nations.</p>
    <p>Development of Genshin Impact began in 2017. The game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's combat mechanics and immersive open world, but criticizing its simplistic endgame and monetization model. It had a first-year launch revenue of more than $3 billion in its first year of release, the highest for any video game, and a reveneue of more than $4 billion as of March 2022.</p>
